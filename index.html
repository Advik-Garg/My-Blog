                <h4>I visited Honaululu, Hawaii 2 years ago. It was a AMAZING expirence and I think that you have to try it out. I went there for a week and I went to a beach everyday! On the last day, I even went snorkeling! I saw all kinds of fish and sea animals in the ocean that day. That trip to Hawaii is one of my all-time favorites! You could do all kinds of activities in the ocean and I did surfing! It was so fun. You HAVE TO VIST HAWAII!! </h4>

                <p>Part 1 of this most ambitious, larger than life attempt to depict a heist showing an ever supreme antagonist climb his way to d summit of world domination n annihilation succeeds not only as a visual spectacle but also has a satisfying emotional quotient to it...
D expectations were magnanimous & so were d stakes, but hats off to d Russos' in ticking almost every box possible with a healthy mix of humor n sentiment,
A terrifically good number of breathtaking action sequences, some quirky one liners, smartly splitting d cast to give adequate screen time for most to shine, backed with some impeccable editing makes sure dat even at nearly 3 hour length...it's not a bumpy ride, not even once!
It's particularly interesting to see the CGI character (Thanos) being portrayed as powerful yet flawed, savage yet merciful, determined yet emotionally drained...which is quite refreshing compared to other recent CGI villains who were utterly forgettable,
D climax is a bit unusual, but dat was d whole point I guess to pave way for part 2 to dictate terms...
Yes, it does feel a bit rushed in places...but d task was huge n I guess it's b best Dey cud do wen u have 18 movies n over 50+ characters to justify</p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>
